This mod changes some 1.4 recipes (and item stats) into the 1.3 Modloader! With this mod, it takes less materials to craft items, and you can craft previously unavailable items, such as the Band of Starpower in a Crimson world!
Visit the Homepage to view all changes!

Check the config to disable features you don't like!
