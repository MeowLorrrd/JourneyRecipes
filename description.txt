This mod changes some 1.4 recipes (and item stats) into the 1.3 Modloader! With this mod, it takes less materials to craft items, and you can craft previously unavailable items, such as the Band of Starpower in a Crimson world!

Check the config to disable features you don't like!

[c/ff0000:NOTE]: 1.4 tModLoader is coming closer to full release, so I won't be updating this mod anymore (or not as much). I will probably make a 1.4 QoL mod, but we'll see :)

[i:549]Current changes[i:549]:
-[c/FF0000:D][c/FFFE00:y][c/00FF00:e][c/0000FF:s]

-[c/ae1e32:Adamantite Bar] & [c/5b5a78:Titanium Bar]  
 (now takes 4 ore instead of 5)

 (e.g. [i:1344] > [i/s2:2627])

-[c/a59479:Enchanted Boomerang]
 (e.g. [i:284] + [i:75] > [i:55])

-[c/9F6C22:Chests]
 (Frozen Chest, Skyware Chest, Lihzahrd Chest and Living 
 Wood Chest are now craftable!)
 (e.g. [i/s8:824] + [i/s2:704] > [i:838])

-[c/0c7977:Terra Blade] (and components)
 (The Terra Blade, True Night's Edge & True Excalibur have 
 different recipes and stats!)
 (e.g. [i:675] + [i:674] + [i:1570] = [i:757])
 (e.g. True Excalibur [i:674] now pierces once!)

-[i:1344]Config![I:1344]
 (Enable/disable this mod's features!)

-Most weapons have 1.4 stats!
 (e.g. Brand of the Inferno[i:3823] is bigger, deals more damage 
 and swings faster! (also fixed Striking Moment buff tooltip))

-Most armor sets have 1.4 stats!
 (e.g. Spooky Breastplate[i:1833] gives one extra minion slot, all 
 Spooky pieces gives +3 defense and Leggings[i:1834] gives 
 +20% movement speed!)

-Throwing is changed to ranged!
 (Weapons do Ranged damage instead of Throwing and Armor 
 has new bonuses)

[i:549]Notes[i:549]:
I won't add items added in 1.4, such as 'Stone Platform' or 'Ultrabright Helmet', since that is property of Re-Logic, and I don't want do deal with copyright stuff.
